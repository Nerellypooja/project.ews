            <h2>1. Form a Plan</h2>
            <p>For proper weld preparation, it’s important to have a plan before getting started. Otherwise, it’s easy to jump fully into a project that seems simple and then quickly discover there are many factors that can lead to costly delays, additional steps, or rework. Having a plan also helps you resist the urge to take shortcuts when issues arise.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step">
            <h2>2. Cut, Fit, Bevel</h2>
            <p>Once your plan is in place, the second step in preparing metal for welding is often cutting, fitting, and beveling the base material. The amount of care and preparation you put into the initial cut can reduce the amount of work that goes into cleaning later.</p>
            <p>Many tools can be used for cutting, including a torch/plasma cutter, shears, laser/waterjet/CNC tables, and manual tools such as cutting wheels. Each type has pros and cons.</p>
            <p>Making the initial cut as clean, straight, and consistent as possible will make it easier for you to produce quality results. Offhand cutting with a right-angle grinder is inexpensive, portable, and does not require as much setup and maintenance as most of the other options. However, to achieve clean, straight cuts, you need a fair amount of practice and skill.</p>
            <p>A clean, consistent gap between the two pieces to be welded will produce a stronger, more consistent weld with less filler metal, reducing costs and saving time.</p>

            <h2>3. Choose the Optimal Grit</h2>
            <p>A common misconception is that a coarse abrasive will always get the job done faster. While it’s true that coarser, more aggressive abrasive will remove material faster, that’s not always a good thing.</p>
            <p>Using an abrasive that is too coarse can remove excess material or damage the surface. Removing too much material may put the finished part outside final specifications and tolerance. Because the scratch pattern is coarser, it can also be more difficult to see surface imperfections and cracks during visual inspection. While you may not remove material as quickly with a finer abrasive, it’s often more productive, can minimize the number of passes needed to achieve the desired finish in less time, and can prevent rework.</p>
