        <h1>Welding Processes</h1>
        <p>
            The 4 Most Popular Types of Welding Procedures are mentioned below.
        </p>
        <section>
            <h2>1) Gas Metal Arc Welding (GMAW/MIG)</h2>
            <p>
                This style of welding is also referred to as Metal Inert Gas (MIG). It uses a shielding gas along the
                wire electrode, which heats up the two metals to be joined. This method requires a constant voltage and
                direct-current power source, and is the most common industrial welding process which includes plate and
                large bore pipe.
            </p>
            <h3>The GMAW/MIG welding process uses four primary methods of metal transfer:</h3>
            <li><strong>Globular transfer:</strong> produces a rougher weld bead due to metal droplet size and the
                propensity for spattering. This method is useful for welding thick metal plates in horizontal
                positions.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Short-circuiting:</strong> works as the name implies â€“ the welding wire contacts the base
                metal in a quickly repeated tapping method many times per second. Because little spattering is produced
                in the process, this method can be used in any welding position.
            </li>

            <h2>2) Gas Tungsten Arc Welding (GTAW/TIG)</h2>
            <p>
                Welding together thick sections of stainless steel or non-ferrous metals is the most common use for
                this method. It is an arc-welding process that uses a fixed consumable tungsten electrode to produce the
                weld. This process is much more time consuming than MIG, Stick or Flux Cored Arc Welding.
            </p>
            <p>
                The melting point of non-ferrous metals vary considerably, so care must be taken in identifying the
                composition of the base metal. Stainless Steel and Steel both contain Iron, however, to be considered
                Stainless Steel, the metal must contain at least 11% Chromium. Carbon Steel melts in the 2,600 to
                2,800-degree F range.
            </p>
            <p>
                The presence of 11% chromium in stainless steel narrows that temperature range to the 2,750+/- degree F
                mark. But nothing shows welding skills more than the intricate ability to TIG weld aluminum. This skill
                takes a steady hand, trained eye, and an artistic touch to create a smooth, amazing weld.

            <h2>3) Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW)</h2>
            <p>
                With this particular type of welding, the welder follows a manual process of stick welding. The stick
                uses an electric current to form an arc between the stick and the metals to be joined. This is often
                used in the construction of steel structures and in industrial fabrication to weld iron, steel and
                using the open V-Groove when welding with mild steel pipe.
                It is vital that the welder must be able to weld to a level in which their work can pass a destructive
                type of bend test. While shielded metal arc welding is used to join carbon steel, alloyed steels,
                stainless steel, cast iron, and ductile iron, it can also be used for some non-ferrous metal
                applications like Nickel and Copper. It is rarely used on Aluminum.

            <h2>4) Flux Cored Arc Welding (FCAW)</h2>
            <p>
                This was developed as an alternative to shield welding. The semi-automatic arc weld is often used in
                construction projects, thanks to its high welding speed and portability. This method has many variables
                making it applicable in a variety of welding projects. Variables often depend on the model of welder
                being used, and what type of wire was chosen for the application. The flexibility is broadened by the
                many operating angles, voltage levels, polarity used, as well as the speed of the wire feed. Due to the
                potential of faster welding speeds, the newly joined metal cools quicker. If the welding technician is
                using a flux cored wire, he or she must be on the lookout for porosity in the welded joint. Flux Cored
                Arc Welding is best used in either outdoor settings or under industrial ventilation hoods, due to the
                amount of smoke and fumes created during the welding process.
