            alt="10 Welding Safety Rules">

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>1. Conduct in a designated safe location</h2>
            <p>Always perform welding activities in an area that is specifically designated for welding. This ensures that all safety measures are in place and reduces the risk of accidents.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>2. Protect yourself from fire hazards</h2>
            <p>Keep flammable materials away from the welding area and have a fire extinguisher nearby. This will help prevent any potential fire outbreaks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>3. Consider the risks</h2>
            <p>Understand the potential hazards associated with welding, such as burns, electric shock, and exposure to harmful fumes, and take appropriate measures to mitigate these risks.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>4. Maintain your equipment</h2>
            <p>Regularly inspect and maintain welding equipment to ensure it is in good working condition. Faulty equipment can lead to accidents and injuries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>5. Protect yourself with the correct PPE</h2>
            <p>Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) such as welding helmets, gloves, and protective clothing to safeguard against burns and other injuries.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>6. Check for ventilation</h2>
            <p>Ensure that the welding area is well-ventilated to prevent the accumulation of harmful fumes and gases, which can be hazardous to your health.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>7. Protect yourself from fumes and gases</h2>
            <p>Use proper respiratory protection to avoid inhaling harmful fumes and gases produced during welding processes.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>8. Protect other workers</h2>
            <p>Make sure that other workers in the vicinity are also protected from welding hazards, such as sparks and harmful radiation.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>9. Read warning labels, relevant documents and keep training</h2>
            <p>Always read and understand the warning labels on welding materials and equipment. Keep up with training and stay informed about safety protocols.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule">
            <h2>10. Enforce Safety Procedures</h2>
            <p>Adhere to established safety procedures and ensure that all workers follow them consistently to maintain a safe working environment.</p>
